Some weights of SegformerForSemanticSegmentation were not initialized from the model checkpoint at nvidia/segformer-b2-finetuned-ade-512-512 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- decode_head.classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([150, 768, 1, 1]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([25, 768, 1, 1]) in the model instantiated
- decode_head.classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([150]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([25]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
